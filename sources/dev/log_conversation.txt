 On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?

Its amazing and ever evolving. , from tag: Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.  

 I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2! 

 Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is? 

 Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it? 

 Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director. 

 I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not! 

 Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor. 

 I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music! 

 That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics. 

 Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome? 

 Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago! 

 I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha. 

 Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us! 

 I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way! 

 Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed. 

 That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways! 

 Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!

 I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%? 

 yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican 

 Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too! 

 They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election 

 Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!

 Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections. 

 Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.   

 The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess.

ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?, from tag: Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person. 

 That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918. 

 I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918.  

 I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected.  

 That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted?  

 I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993.  

 I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections.  

 Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter. 
Yes and then he also invented names like Jessica, Olivia and Miranda, from tag: Yes like good riddance, in my heart of hearts and such

 For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth? 

 Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter. 

 I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election? 

 Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years. 

 That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it.  
Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. , from tag: It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the "protection of animals act". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it 

 Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence! 

 Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4", I should run for president lol.  

 Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy. 

 Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again? 

 It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people. 

 Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas? 

 Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits. 
I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years., from tag: Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy. 

 Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too. 

 I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha. 

 For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more! 

 Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.

 Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means.  

 Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.    

 Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport. 

 Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches.  

 Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands. 

 As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ? 
haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?, from tag: How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species! 

 I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?  

 Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth.  

 Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV. 

 Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children. 

 It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games? 

 There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries.  

 The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat! 

 You too, have a good evening. 
Do you know much about politics?, from tag: You too! Have a good night!! 

 Hi there are you a baseball fan? 
How are you?, from tag: greeting 

 i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You? 

 I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed. 

 I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager. 

 I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time. 

 yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player. 

 Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing. 

 Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig. 

 Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot. 

 Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do? 

 I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol 

 Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all? 

 I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU! 
Goodbye, from tag: goodbye 

 Really? the womens game? do men play as well? 

 lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings! 

 Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000. 

 No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day. 

 He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball.  

 Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting! 

 Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend! 

 You have a great weekend too! 
Do you know much about politics?, from tag: You too! Have a good night!! 

 Hi, how are you doing this fine evening? 
I'm doing good, from tag: how_are_you 

 Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen? 
Just chilling, from tag: how_are_you 

 I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs? 

 Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called"Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen 

 HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? 

 I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character 

 that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? 

 There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. 

 Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent. 

 I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set 

 Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well. 

 Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves 

 A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though. 

 Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist 
Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish., from tag: That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication! 

 I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice. 

 I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash? 

 The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward. 

 Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha! 

 Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you! 

 I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha 

 Have a good night 
Goodbye, from tag: goodbye 

 Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can 

 Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught. 

 Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter 

 Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws. 

 Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult 

 Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members. 

 It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that 

 You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid. 

 I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school 
I was born in August 2001, from tag: bot_age 

 Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation. 

 Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie 

 Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety. 

 I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago! 

 I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen? 

 Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes! 
Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!, from tag: Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas.  

 Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess. 

 yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait! 
Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? , from tag: Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? 

 Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!! 

 Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember... 

 Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva. 

 Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to "de-feminize" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/ 

 hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day! 

 Have a lovely day as well :) 
Goodbye, from tag: goodbye 

 Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of "Frozen" the movie? I personally Looooved it! 

 I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids? 

 both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars 
Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections., from tag: He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny.  

 That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs? 

 That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that? 

 I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower? 

 Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch? 

 I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually. 

 Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown 

 I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.

 Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923! 

 Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it. 

 Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney 

 I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers. 

 Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius! 

 It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time. 

 Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing!  

 Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps. 

 Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more! 

 That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people! 

 Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :) 

 Have a good evening! 

 you too 

 I have never heard of Fanfest, 

 Hey! What is FanFest? lol 

 I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol 

 Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games? 

 No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military 

 It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange.  

 it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12 

 after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood. 

 But would you categorize them as an art form? 

 Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion? 

 I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form 

 It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games. 

 Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well 

 Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball? 

 I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson? 

 Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember. 

 I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers. 

 Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha  

 maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe 

 Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol 

 Thank you for your time but I must go now 

 Have a good day! Thanks. 

 bye 

 bye! 

 Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance? 

 No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it? 

 Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there. 

 No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL 

 Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance? 

 Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal 

 Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play? 

 LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha 

 I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool. 

 Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks 

 Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though. 

 Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL 

 I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things. 

 I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry 

 Stephen Fry from Top Gear? 

 I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV? 

 I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way? 

 Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol 

 Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you? 

 No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money 

 Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night! 

 Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun 

 Hi, how are you? 

 Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all? 

 A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it? 

 I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers. 

 I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it. 

 Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention. 

 Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too! 

 Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind! 

 I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that! 

 Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that. 

 I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it. 

 That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens. 

 I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers! 

 That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.   

 There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936? 

 Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more. 

 They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks! 

 I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy 

 Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty. 

 Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a "biohazard" 

 Agreed! Nice chatting with you! 

 hey there, do you go out and vote during elections? 

 Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you? 

 me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens? 

 I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.  

 I wonder how that would work today though. 

 Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows.  

 yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot. 

 Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year.  

 I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote 

 Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!

 Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten 

 It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! 

 Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius 

 There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like "nurses run")! 

 Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? 

 I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know "The Raven" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem? 

 Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid 

 Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially. 

 I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction, 

 That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic! 

 That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero 

 Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like. 

 I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good. 

 Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all! 

 Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot? 

 It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days. 

 I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence. 

 Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point. 

 I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that,  

 Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of "computer" that was though. 

 I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech 

 Do you like to use computers?  
I love to dance a lot. How about you?, from tag: Hi!  do you like to dance? 

 Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water. 

 Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.  

 Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty. 

 Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? 

 I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! 

 That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?  

 I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination! 

 I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?  

 I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks. 

 Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible?  

 Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM. 

 I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram.  

 Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts. 

 I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers?  

 I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction. 

 That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki?  

 Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early. 

 Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!

 Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times. 

 Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you? 

 I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.  

 I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related. 

 Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. 

 I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet? 

 I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome! 

 that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts. 

 Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven. 

 He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him. 

 Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal. 

 Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them.  

 That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre? 

 I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.  

 That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from. 

 the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's.  

 Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. 

 Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different. 

 Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon. 

 What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting! 

 Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon. 

 Hello there, do you use Amazon? 

 Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website. 

 Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas.  

 Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post? 

 No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for? 

 No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase? 

 Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.  

 Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it. 

 Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays? 

 No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages. 

 Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks? 

 No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life. 

 Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body.  

 most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks? 

 No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time! 

 Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters? 

 Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well.  

 every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side. 

 Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other.  

 Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog? 

 Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night.  

 Hello friend, Do you like horses? 
Yes  I do. Did you know Bruce Lee was a cha cha dancer?, from tag: do you like dance? 

 I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down? 

 Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today?  

 That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today. 

 Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses. 

 I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating. 

 Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. 

 What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays? 

 Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark. 

 I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body. 

 Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees. 

 Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 

 No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too? 

 I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs. 

 I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z. 

 I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore? 

 Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow. 

 Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ? 

 No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though. 

 I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere. 

 That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you. 

 Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry? 

 Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do! 

 I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa.  

 Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet. 

 That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  

 Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure. 

 Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he? 

 Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy. 

 I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right? 

 Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea? 

 Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it "a biohazard". What in the world could that mean? 

 Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary! 

 Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?! 

 Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes! 

 I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private! 

 Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you! 

 How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM.  

 That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!  

 Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination.  

 Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races. 

 Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.  

 Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you! 

 Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member? 
Hello!, from tag: greeting 

 Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!! 

 It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS. 

 Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95? 

 If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well! 

 I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg! 

 I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk! 

 Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended. 

 Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school! 

 Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies? 
It is very interesting. Google provide "Chrome OS" which is a light weight OS. Google provided a lot of hardware mainly in 2010 to 2015. , from tag: Did you know Google had hundreds of live goats to cut the grass in the past? 
 

 You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead! 

 Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!! 

 Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark! 

   I didn't know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up! 

 They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses. 

 I know, isn't it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren't Lipizzaner horses beautiful!! 

 Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin! 

 Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances! 

 I would love to see them in real life! I'm good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month! 

 Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!! 

 They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night! 
Hello friend, Do you like horses?, from tag: Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night.  

 Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there?  

 Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters! 

 That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  

 They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer 

 I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York! 

 Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft 

 Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world!  

 An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much! 

 It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift. 

 that is a lot! 

 And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so! 

 We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!! 

 Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday! 

 that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore? 

 That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them! 

 that is good! Hey, do you like animals? 

 I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend. 

 Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named "white Shark cafe". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there! 

 Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body.  

 We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors! 

 That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer! 

 Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!! 

 Good morning. 
What do you want to talk about?, from tag: response_to_question 

 good morning 
Is there something you want to talk about?, from tag: response_to_question 

 Do you keep up with the election? 

 yeah, but moderately.  You? 

 yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party. 

 the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election 

 Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time. 

 I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor? 

 I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853 

 Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion? 

 I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.? 

 Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin? 

 I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time? 

 I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name 

 Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election. 

 It is weird, but true 

 The Beatles song "come together" was written for a California governor. 

 There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics. 

 Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S 

 I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you 

 You too. I do not think its in effect though. 

 hi are you a republican? 

 No I am not. How about you? 

 No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. 

 Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome. 

 I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election 

 I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with. 

 For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! 

 Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. 

 Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN! 

 If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP. 

 For sure, and he would take Trump down. 

 I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years. 

 Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged. 

 Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time. 

 For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system 

 Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears. 

 For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times! 

 yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care. 
, from tag: I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section. 

 for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you! 

 Yeah same to you, good chat. 

 bye! 
Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of "Frozen" the movie? I personally Looooved it!, from tag: goodbye 

 Hello, do you follow politics much? 
Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?, from tag: hi, do you use google much? 

 Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard?  

 Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat
 

 Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that 

 Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride? 

 Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo 

 Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?
 

 Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess 

 Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that 

 Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though
 
Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!, from tag: Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early. 

 Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote 

 Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence? 

 Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for? 

 Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969 

 Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day 

 But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day 

 Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934 

 Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw 

 In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment 

 Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII 

 Must have been tough being the only guy. 

 The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree? 

 Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times. 

 Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though 

 That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead. 

 I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either, 

 Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know. 

 So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000 

 That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember. 

 It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont 

 Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63% 
The Beatles song "come together" was written for a California governor., from tag: It is weird, but true 

 And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat 

 So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol 

 We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these'' 

 They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now. 

 They do, seems like the best option at times lol 

 It really does.   
What do you want to talk about?, from tag: response_to_question 

 I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day 

 It really would1 

 It really would1 
:OMEGALUL:, from tag: emoji_talk 

 He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy 

 He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours! 

 Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot 

 What did you think of the last couple elections? 
I did and loved it so much, and you?, from tag: did you watch the movie Frozen? 

 I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote. 

 That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years 

 the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. 

 I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how? 

 i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly. 

 yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not 

 it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones. 

 Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans? 
I'm doing good, from tag: how_are_you 

 well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now. 

 Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right? 
And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!, from tag: that is a lot! 

 no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south.  

 Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2 

 yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna. 

 for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor 

 he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content. 

 He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol 

 yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics. 

 For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state.  
Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper. , from tag: Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him. 

 people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there. 
Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! , from tag: Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft 

 I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you! 

 No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party. 

 I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.   

 Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican. 

 True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college. 

 Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000. 

 That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.   

 Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland. 

 I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand. 

 Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957. 

 It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL 

 Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy. 
Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. , from tag: Does Chewbacca appear in this movie? 

 Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse. 

 Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%. 

 Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data. 

 There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy 

 Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections. 
What about cats, do you like cats? I'm a dog fan myself. , from tag: Yes. Fish is the important resources of human world wide for the commercial and subsistence fish hunts the fish in the wild fisheries. 

 So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020. 

 Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a "none of these" candidates voting option. 
Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  , from tag: Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections. 

 That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates. 
Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  , from tag: Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from! 

 Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment! 

 Do you follow politics?

 I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising. 

 I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853. 

 That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party? 

 That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then. 
Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!, from tag: I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers. 

 Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for Presidential elections? 
I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates., from tag: lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option? 

 I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting. 
There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like "nurses run")!, from tag: Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius 

 Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years. 
Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data., from tag: Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%. 

 That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time. 
Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4", I should run for president lol. , from tag: Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence! 

 Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states. 

 Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do. 

 I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet. 

 There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy 
Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections., from tag: There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy

Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  , from tag: Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections. 

 That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates. 
Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!, from tag: That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.

Sorry, what I meant was "she won the award". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair., from tag: Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie. 

 That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time. 
We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do., from tag: Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.

 It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign. 
Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing, from tag: me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?

Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline., from tag: I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night. 

 Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2? 
It is very interesting. Google provide "Chrome OS" which is a light weight OS. Google provided a lot of hardware mainly in 2010 to 2015. , from tag: Did you know Google had hundreds of live goats to cut the grass in the past? 
 

 I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people.

 It's something else, that's for sure. 

 In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today.
